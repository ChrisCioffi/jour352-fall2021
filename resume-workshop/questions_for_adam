Questions for Adam:

In syllabus" in-class exercises / homework - are they "assignments in elms"

Does ELMS grades get weighted in ELMS "assignment group weights" tab, or do the points add up to your syllabus' weights? --

To make sure grades don't get published until the end, try to use the hide grades tab in ELMS

Get through 6/7 weeks and publish those before you start -- then tell students that you're going to publish them as you get them completed

How do I get a repo that's not my main repo to render webpages?



-- Meeting with Rafael --

For lab issue You can leave if you'd like, but I'd prefer you stick around to get your work done

Also schedule in 10-minute breaks for bathroom, snack, etc.

Get class up a few days before class starts
