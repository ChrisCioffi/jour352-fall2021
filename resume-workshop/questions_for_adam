Questions for Adam:

In syllabus" in-class exercises / homework - are they "assignments in elms"
(Yes)
Does ELMS grades get weighted in ELMS "assignment group weights" tab, or do the points add up to your syllabus' weights? --
The class is set up on a 500 point grading system. All those assignment point values added up, plus 17 points participation equals the grade total.

To make sure grades don't get published until the end, try to use the hide grades tab in ELMS



Get through 6/7 weeks and publish those before you start -- then tell students that you're going to publish them as you get them completed




How do I get a repo that's not my main repo to render webpages?



-- Meeting with Rafael --

For lab issue You can leave if you'd like, but I'd prefer you stick around to get your work done

Also schedule in 10-minute breaks for bathroom, snack, etc.

Get class up a few days before class starts
