Thanks for this. Looks like you sent a url but then changed it... This is the correct url: https://blaket8717.github.io/blake-townsend-jour-352/bootstrap-template/index.html
Make sure, if you change the name of a file, you're accounting for that with your URL.

Also, re: icons not working in class. Please add the short link that I emailed to you. Here's the link to my site with bootstrap icons working and the link properly added. https://chriscioffi.github.io/jour352_cioffi/bootstrap-template/bootstrap-template-grid.html
